Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
None, i'm still pretty intimidated by the upper classmen.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended wednesday sept. 27 TA hours from 7-9 pm
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I am not a fan. I'm doing the transition from Python and Java seems to get angry with me for the smallest reasons and typos.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Programming is heavily based on logic and will be infinitely easier through flowcharts, reading documentation, and just a lot of practice. There is a tradeoff between Python and Java where in Python its more user friendly you dont have as mush free range to mess around and find out and learn as openly as in Java.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
READ THE DOCUMENTATION AND GO TO OFFICE AND TA HOURS. I'll more likely than not have to go again to keep tweaking and improving my code. ALSO PLEASE WRITE AS MUCH COMMENTS AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP YOUR PROGRAM ORGANIZED.
